I still remember the first time I discovered Fira Code. Ligatures quickly found a special place in my heart and in my text editors. Over the past couple years, I
stumbled upon other options and kept them handy as recommendations to my dev friends. Eventually, I made a small site to highlight the collection.


[Yet Another Code Font](https://www.yetanothercodefont.com) is a small, simple, open source, web app dedicated to helping developers find new and interesting fonts, so they don't stick with
Fira Code for the entierty of their career.

If you've been scratching to change up the feel of your development environment, I encourage you to give one of these a try or [contribute](https://github.com/nathanlentz/yet-another-code-font) a font of your own to the list.
